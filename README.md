# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Background
Data from a study about the biodiversity of microbes found in participants navels has been used to create visualizations.  The visualisations aid in the analysis and understanding of the microbial colonization.

You can use the dashboard to explore the results per study participant and may notice the trends identified in the study.

## Navigation
1. Upon loading the dashboard will display the visualizations and metadata for the first study participant
2. To explore the visualizations for the other particpants, use the drop down to select the particpant id

## Visualizations

### Meta Data Table
The meta data table displays the data collected on the selected study participant including ethnicity, gender, age, location and wash frequency (per week).


### Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
The bar graph shows the top 10 microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) found the sample taken from the selected participant.


### Washing Frequency (per week) Guage
The guage displays the wash frequency per week for the selected study participant.


### Bacteria Cultures per Sample
The bubble chart provides visualization on the concentration of each of the microbial species found in the sample for the selected study participant.  The larger the bubble is, the more prevelant that microbial species was in the sample.
